# METEOR + Vue.js

This repository contains the code-example and [the slides](Meteor-&-VueJs-slides.pdf) I prepared fot my talk on the Vue.js // Berlin Meetup on 13. frebruary 2018. The code example is directly derived from the [official Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app), all credits go to the original author. The code was further simplified for the purpose of the talk and do not represent in any way a good example how you should structure/develop a Meteor aplication.

You have to install Meteor locally. For further details see the [official documentation](https://www.meteor.com/install). Then just simply enter simple-todos directory, do `npm install` and execute `meteor` from the terminal.
